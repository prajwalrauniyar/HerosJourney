To see plot of Rewards or Q-Values (Whichever algo is set) set
    plot_Q = True
Else set
    plot_Q = False

    for default values (0 and 1) set them to None

    "reg_call_reward"
    
To alter the number of iterations the Learning runs for change the variable
    "num_iter"
    
To change the parameters \gamma and \alpha of Q-Learning set the variables
    "gamma" and "alpha"
    
To set the Max and Min cash the agent begins with change
    "max_cash" and "min_cash"
    
To alter the Goal coordinates on the board change
